# Ark Nova Scripted

In order to get this working for development, you will need to put the latest save in your TTS directory. You will also need to do the following:
  - Install Atom and TTS plugin
  - Create the folder '~/Documents/My Games/Tabletop Simulator/Tabletop Simulator Lua'
  - In the new lua folder, clone this into 'ArkNova' directory
  - Change Atom settings for TTS:
    - Check 'enable require()'
    - Change bundle file patterns to 'Tabletop Simulator Lua\?.ttslua;Tabletop Simulator Lua\?.lua;?.lua;?.ttslua;'
